scrapy_cfp
==========
This project is a test project aiming at learning to develope useful datamining tools with "scrapy".

The purpose is collecting "Call for papers" information of upcoming security conferences.

The developement environement is python2.7 along with some useful tools such as virtualenv, pip, ipython and vim.

#P.S
Activate syntax coloring in vim:
==> echo "syntax on" >> $HOME/.vimrc
Install Ipython in virtualenv used so that scrapy shell will use it instead:
==> pip install ipython
